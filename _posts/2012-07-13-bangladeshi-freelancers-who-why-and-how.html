<p>One day I just saw that one of my Facebook friend has updated his career as 'Freelancer at DoLancer' hahahaha. Really it's funny.</p>
<p>Actually Who are Bangladeshi Freelancers and why they are doing freelancing and how they are?achieving their goal by doing freelancing. Freelancing is really a great starting to start professional career. But in the view of Bangladeshi Job Market Freelancers of Bangladesh are being idle about our own country job.</p>
<p>[adsense_id="3"]</p>
<p>Our IT job market is growing so fast but in most cases IT companies aren't able to find right candidate for their expected job position. Because of what? From my personal thinking it is because of freelancing. Freelancers are loosing their own creative and updated way. They are bidding on jobs and earning money. It's so easy and even boring. But do we know that Freelancers are being centralized to few specific job. Few of our freelancers are introducing themselves as SEO specialized, few of them are telling that they can develop webpage by Wordpress. Few of them are telling that they can earn money and they can ride bike. Lolzz.. I am so much astonished to see their conversation.</p>
<p>Actually are they improving their career field or they are loosing themselves inside the water of freelancing? Bangladeshi freelancers need more knowledge and they need to know what is the meaning of real job or real work which can enlighten their real future.</p>

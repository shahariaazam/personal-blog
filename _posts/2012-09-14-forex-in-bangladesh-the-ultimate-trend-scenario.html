<p>After falling down of most of the MLM (Multi-level marketing) companies in Bangladesh recently most of the young people are interested to do Forex in Bangladesh. Some of them are familiar with Forex, some of them are not familiar, some of them are totally new at Forex. So this is the real fact because Forex is a very risky place where people can be rich in a second and even a person can lose all of his money in a second. So be careful always.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, Forex has been banned by Bangladesh Bank but if you can personally handle or invest money on Forex then it is OK than by going to a forex training institute. Few bad people has made this Forex bad in Bangladesh. Forex in Bangladesh has made a great interest to the people and still day by day this numbers are increasing. People are eager to know what's happening there and there about Forex. Few months ago a significant number of Forex Training Institute in Bangladesh grew up and after the notice by Bangladesh Bank none of them are active because most of those companies are here to collect a large number of money by motivating general people.</p>

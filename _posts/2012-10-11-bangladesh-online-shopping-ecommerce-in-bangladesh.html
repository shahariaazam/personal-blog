<p>There are various kinds of websites in Bangladesh who are providing online shopping in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Online Shopping sites can't grow so fast because of trasportation and payment gateway system. There are lots of bangladeshi ecommerce websites are still inactive because of their payment gateway. Now few payment gateway companies are now providing API facility for the Bangladeshi ecommerce website but those are high costly.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1752" title="online-store-Bangladesh" src="http://www.shahariaazam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/online-store-Bangladesh.jpg" alt="Bangladesh Online Shopping" width="426" height="282" /></p>
<p>Because of this crisis situation few of Bangladeshi Online shopping sites are still alive and rest of them are still playing behind the scene. What's the problem and where are their obstacles they still doesn't know. Bangladeshi people are developing their online shopping website with open source ecommerce cms. And that's why they can't implement their whole ideas into it because to customize the open source CMS it is tough to get the right skilled web developer in Bangladesh. So it's better that just open a ecommerce website and run inside a CMS.</p>
<p>Most of the bangladeshi online shopping site like ClickBD, HutBazaar, and etc etc are doing good but not better what it should be because of their technical limitations. Bangladeshi government is saying that they are extending their options to build digital ecommerce system in Bangladesh but we are not seeing those actions practically. So we are just stack in this situations. We need better ecommerce payment gateway, better functionality inside an online shopping site.</p>

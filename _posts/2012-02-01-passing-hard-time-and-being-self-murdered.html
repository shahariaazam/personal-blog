<p>As a very deep thinking person I am passing a very much hard time in my life and being self murdered. Slowly I am destroying my sweet sessions of life. I don't know that neither I will be happy or not. Though I am still making hope and running towards my dreams.</p>
<p>Passing obstacles, and facing another brick of obstacles. Totally it's a matter of being disappointed. Don't know where is the limit beyond my sorrow. Still I am sleeping underneath dreams. I haven't any questions to GOD.. Just want to ask GOD why he is continuously showing me the situation similar to death. Sometimes I think death is near to me and my life is being going to be death. I don't get any answers from GOD. Only GOD knows what's another chapters are still remaining in my life. I consider all of these are my primary lesson. And I want to be ready for my higher level of lessons. Continuously I am being hopeless and after a few moments again I am seeing dreams, hope. Nobody know me better than myself.</p>
<p>Slowly going to the near stage of death. But I want to struggle and I want to see the brighter light in my life which I am looking for. Life is going. Sadness covers me sometimes. Dreams make me awake. Sorrow bring tears and small kicking to obstacle make me enough happy. I am being slowly unable to solve the puzzle of my life. And I am being afraid. In this lonely world of living, I am going alone, I am walking alone, I am running alone and I am destroying myself alone. I can't blame anybody for the situations. It's totally related to my thinking capacity, problem solving capacity and struggling power and inspirational backup that was generated by myself. I am leading a continuously?desperate?situation of my life. Why I bring the problem to solve a problem. And each problem is greater than the previous problem. Why? My philosophy for sadness never betray me but why again I see dreams and fall in down into hope?</p>
<p>Questions and answers of all of the above questions are still remaining hidden. Dream is making me alive always. Thanks GOD for making me such a struggling boy.</p>

If you are a PHP coder just leave Dreamweaver. If you are novice website designer Dreamweaver is perfect. Now I can feel that how much bad the Dreamweaver is as an IDE! I prefer <a title="JetBrains PHPStorm IDE keyboard shortcuts for faster PHP coding" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm" target="_blank" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=215115471838115">PhpStorm</a> as my PHP IDE. Really PHPStorm is a great PHP editor for faster PHP application development. Since 3 years I used Adobe Dreamweaver but now I can be sure that Dreamweaver is such a novice playground. So if you want to be a PHP coder you should switch your IDE and you can consider PHPStorm. It&#8217;s really great to have a great coding environment.

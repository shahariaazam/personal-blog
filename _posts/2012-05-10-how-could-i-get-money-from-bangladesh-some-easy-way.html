<div>?In this days there is a buzzword that 'How Could I get money or How could I earn money from Bangladesh'. Most of the young people are so much familiar with Freelancing, Earn from home in Bangladesh, MLM Business in Bangladesh. So there are so many earning opportunities in Bangladesh. I believe it is... but my question is what is perfect for you? I even don't know what is the perfect and best way to earn money from Bangladesh easily. Also I believe that few fraud or temporary business company (real &amp; unreal) are showing over hundreds even thousands job opportunities in Bangladesh. Most of the young boy want to know about How could I get money from Bangladesh or how to earn online from Bangladesh or how to earn online in Bangladesh. I hope you are one of them who is reading this writings.</div>

<div>?There are lots of way to earn money from Bangladesh or earn online from Bangladesh. There are so many opportunities for Bangladeshi but the sad thing is day by day it's going to worst part because of us. I am not talking about any traditional business or earning scheme that is related to earn online from Bangladesh. But I am going to put a list to earn money from Bangladesh ( which is the most trending topics in Bangladesh). There are-<br />
1. oDesk<br />
2. MLM<br />
3. PTC Website with MLM business concept<br />
4. Commission by share</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Absolutely few people will fraud with people and few people will do business by people. It's system not for Bangladesh. But in Bangladesh 98% such types of business strategy is to do fraud with people.</div>
<div>From my above list, obviously oDesk is a popular and top 5 freelancer's marketplace where you can earn money from Bangladesh by doing work of foreigners. But recently researching some facts quality of works from Bangladesh is bad than previous and it is obviously negative and event it can destroy our foreign revenue sector in Bangladesh.</div>
<div>
<p>[adsense_id="1"]</p>
<div>?oDesk is free to join and oDesk hasn't any condition to start bidding on project. But there are so many young who hasn't any technical skills but they are signing up for oDesk account by finishing any un-effective outsourcing course from Bangladesh so in this case now a days in oDesk there are minimum 40 contractors are bidding on average for a single job. So it's quite complex for buyer to choose the right and skilled one. In this case buyer may chose wrong person and the quality is not being so professional so buyer are being familiar that 'There are so much freelancers in Bangladesh but quality is not so good'. So it's really bad for us. So we should actually browse the skill list, prioritize job in oDesk and then we should be skilled ourselves by self learning, courses from any effective way. So that oDesk can be a great choice for lifetime earning. So for skilled worker oDesk is great to earn money online from Bangladesh.</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>[adsense_id="3"]</p>
<div>?Also there is being a popular buzzword that is 'MLM' that is called actually Multi-Level Marketing. With this business model multi-zero figure number of young are being demotivated for being skilled. Because someone is earning from them. But none of the MLM company in Bangladesh (who are publishing that their company is giving you the money and it is the easy earn money online from Bangladesh) are doing right work. they are earning from the MLM Tree calculation but actually they are destroying our skilled human resource in Bangladesh. So most of the MLM business owners plan to earn some money and they will shut their business off after they got the money and their subscribers or clients or users will walk through sunny road again for searching another MLM company. So MLM Companies of Bangladesh are just doing business with people and they are making us fool and event they are destroying our beloved young generation by giving them fraud online money earning facility from Bangladesh.</div>
<div>
<p>[adsense_id="4"]</p>
<div>?Recently also PTC (PayToClick) sites are increasing and they are telling that users are clicking on Advertisements and they are earning money online from Bangladesh. But this advertisements clicking can never get something better for youngs than money. But this earning can't be an ultimate income solution for a Bangladeshi young. There are lots of PTC sites in Bangladesh but most of them are making us fool by showing few freaking advertisements.</div>
<div>
<p>[adsense_id="1"]</p>
<div>?Also there are some commission based business model and the business owners are promoting their business by saying that 'Invest money here and make double within short term'. Everything is just false and it's like pretty shit. I am so much afraid of their strategy. Ultimately the young generations are being demotivated and they are going to the wrong way.</div>

<p>On 12 January 2012 <a title="Bangladesh bank circular on Forex Trading from Bangladesh" href="http://www.bangladesh-bank.org">Bangladesh Bank</a> has published a public circular on <span class="hihglight2">Forex Trading from Bangladesh</span>. It says any kinds of illegal activities related to Forex trading has been banned. And any kinds of fraudent activities will not be permitted by government authorities.</p>
<p>So Forex is not banned from Bangladesh.  Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947 these kinds of activities will be considered as crime. Because only authorized foreign exchanger can exchange money. So for becoming more conscious Bangladesh bank has published this circular recently.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1855" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-1855" title="Bangladesh Bank circular on Forex trading from Bangladesh" alt="Bangladesh Bank circular on Forex trading from Bangladesh" src="http://www.shahariaazam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Forex-Trading-Circular-Bangladesh-Bank-300x260.jpg" width="300" height="260" /> Bangladesh Bank Circular on Forex Trading[/caption]</p>
<p>To download the circular of Bangladesh Bank click this link <a href="http://www.bangladesh-bank.org/mediaroom/notice/jan201212bfepd.pdf">Bangladesh bank circular on forex trading from Bangladesh </a></p>
<p>So we should be more aware of this issue. It is happening throughout the country. To learn forex you don't need to go to any institution and please remember Forex can never be a money making machine. Just think, "You have the money and you want to invest those money to any foreign country's economy'. To do forex business it requires huge knowledge on International economy. So always you should understand what you are planning to invest your money through any training institutions. Thousands of people are investing money through various kinds of training institutions on Forex trading. In Bangladesh still there is no forex trading brokerage. If you want to do forex business do it yourself if you have enough knowledge on Forex. "<a title="Learn to do Forex trading from Bangladesh" href="http://www.shahariaazam.com/forex-trading-from-bangladesh">How forex trading can be done from Bangladesh</a>".</p>
<div class="tip_box">NEVER GO TO ANY TRAINING INSTITUTE FOR LEARNING FOREX. JUST STUDY YOURSELF AND INVEST YOURSELF</div>
<div class="note_box">FOREX IS NOT A MONEY MAKING MACHINE. IT'S ABOUT TO INVEST MONEY FOR FOREIGN ECONOMY</div>
<p>Honestly, Forex is very much interesting investment sector but you have to study a lots. You have to understand the world economy. Because billion billion dollar is being invested in this forex trade and your $50, $100, $1000, $5000, $1000 is not good where multi-billion dollar persons are gambling with this.</p>

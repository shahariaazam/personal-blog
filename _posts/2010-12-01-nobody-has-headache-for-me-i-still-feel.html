<p>Yes, really it's true. But why I am feelings? Really nobody has headache for me because something is not going OK. What I am doing or what I am trying to reveal or what I need or what I need to do or what I am going to do or what I am thinking about them aren't the matter to them.</p>
<p>Everybody are continuing everything but am I in the trap at last? So what should I do?</p>
<p>I have few plans for my own company Preview ICT, but some energetic guys has just gone away or trying to go away. I don't know why. I wanted to recruit them for some bigger responsibility. So they are making me lonely. It's not fair. I am trying to fill up the gaps but it will not be really good like that whether it is more professional than before.</p>
<p>Personal life? Hahaha, it's also going amazing. I am the field and a soccer game has been started. Sometimes after sometimes the game paused and after a while it again resume. No doubt, I am the field. With love, dreams, frustration, broken dreams I am going. I don't know really what's going on. Why I am not getting any constant behavior, constant environment, continuous situations without any vibrating. I don't know. Just waiting for making everything continuous.</p>

<p>Whole night I worked for bdwebdeveloper.com and I am happy that Google adsense can be used with one approved account to many website. And just I have inserted Google Adsense to all of our services that can lead some revenue which will be used for maintaining the Bangladeshi Web Developer's Online Community.</p>
<p>We are working with this community very well. But it still needs many works to do. We are still working for this.</p>
<p>Thanks everybody who are working with me.</p>

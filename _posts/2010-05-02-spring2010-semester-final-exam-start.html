<p>I am not attending in the semester final exam because of my poor preparation &amp; financial crisis.</p>
<p>Another cause is that few days I can't concentrate on my varsity study. Now I want to restart my academic life that will obviously help me, I hope.</p>
<p>It is not a bad news for me. It is a news for build again my strength.</p>
<p>Thanks, Pray for me.</p>

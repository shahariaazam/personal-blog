<p>Tonight I have worked on something. I will tell that after finishing. It can change our country and the idea can change the world even much more better. I am also working hard to complete it. I am working lonely but some of my background emotion or loneliness and my dream, my aim is my only the source of inspiration. Thanks GOD to giving me the opportunity to show something to the world.</p>
<p>I know it already discovered but I think my creativity is my own creativity and my theme is really still unrevealed. So waiting for that day when everybody will remind me for my creativity and my work. I always give thanks to my friends, my loneliness. I also want to give thanks to them who tells that I am falling down. But not, something stills remain in my mind. I don't want to lose my heart's special corner. I am alive, I am not sleeping still working on my way. Want to shine through my own world.</p>
<p>I have nobody, really nobody but I have my dream. Every night I sleep with my dream. And now after finishing some of my creative work I am going to sleep. Some extra dreams are just knocking at the door. I need to welcome them. Good bye.</p>

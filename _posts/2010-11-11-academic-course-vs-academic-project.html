<p>What is the source of power? Knowledge is power. How we can get knowledge? There are various source of knowledge. Naturally we know from our school, college &amp; university called academic study. We have several topic, we read it &amp; then make sure that we don?t forget it. That means we are memorizing. What is the benefit of memorizing? I don?t know but of course there are benefits.</p>
<p>In the university if there are several topics not lots topic there are a chance of repetition. Yaa, a question can arise what kind of repetition, its question repetition.? What I?m reading now, it has been read by the immediate previous batch. There are 70 to 80 % chances to be the same question. It?s pretty easy to get the good mark if I follow the previous question. If the course teachers notice it, there is nothing to do, because there are no other questions.? I think it would be the right judgment of a student merit. Yes, the question can be get return with the answer script but still the problem does not solved. Actually through this system what can we learn, it?s a big question. Why we don?t do real project each &amp; every term? We can divide the course duration. The half of duration we will study about the course &amp; the second half duration we will do a project. I?m sure when a student going to do a project he/she need to study a lot, because it not like memorizing. When a student will do his/her project he/she never become abele to forget it. Now compare it with the memorizing, after few days, few weeks, and few moths or few years you will forget your memorizing? ?study. But when a student do project he/she never forget it, even if try to forget it but he/she can?t it. It?s the amazing part of your memory.</p>

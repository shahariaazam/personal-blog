<p>I should say first "Don't be confused" because I am not trying to establish my own opinion with this writing. I want to just discuss about this matter what is going on all around us. So let's explain some intrduction.</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Click for further information about this quotation" href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2573.html">Be  courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well  tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant  of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity  before it is entitled to the appellation.</a></p>
<p>-George Washington</p></blockquote>

<p>July 31 was the date to make the table hot by Microsoft. Since many days they wanted to make them on the discussion table. And at last they just made it by their newly introduced Outlook.com email [YourName@outlook.com].</p>
<p>At first day over 1 million users have signed up for their outlook.com email and Microsoft claims that this is the biggest fight with Gmail by Microsoft while Gmail has 425 million users and?Hotmail had more than 350 million at the last count. You can read <a title="outlook.com email reaches 1 million signup" href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/07/31/introducing-outlook-com-modern-email-for-the-next-billion-mailboxes.aspx">the blog post of Outlook</a> to see all of their features with outlook.com email. Microsoft's outlook.com email is bringing few exclusive features like integrating twitter, skype with their outlook.com email (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20120355-264/microsoft-closes-$8.5-billion-skype-acquisition/">Google acquired Skype with $8.5 Billion</a>). And is it for making their stand more harder against gmail? We will discuss about it later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In a <a title="Outlook.com on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/Outlook">@Outlook</a>?twitter status it published their success graph about 1 million user sign up in 24 hours.<br />
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1539" title="Outlook.com email got 1 million user signup in their first 24 hours" src="http://www.shahariaazam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/out.png" alt="" width="488" height="317" /></p>
<p>So don't wait. Let's signup for your desired yourname@outlook.com</p>
<p>[All the YourUsername@Hotmail.com has been changed to YourUsername@outlook.com]</p>

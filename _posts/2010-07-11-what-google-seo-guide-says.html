<h1>What Google SEO guide says about your SEO campaign</h1>
<p>We are blind!!! Aren't we, huh!!!? We only want to depend on another expert for everything. But do we know that that expert was also a self learner? Yes, most of the SEO expert who says many many valuable (?) words which is available all over the internet most of them are self learner. I am also as like as them.</p>
<p>[youtube]OlP4PFFqAXs[/youtube]</p>
<p>But competition is where a person can implement their SEO techniques, how many experienced SEO expert is he, how many website &amp; web tools he has used. Actually I am trying to say you that "You don't need to pay or hire someone for your SEO campaign". Because you are the website owner &amp; if you want you can be also a self learner &amp; you can run your SEO campaign by yourself.</p>
<p>But the main problem is that we can't know ourselves. We are not trying to be self dependent. Am I right? I don't want to hurt anybody but want to grow some consciousness among the people who are looking around for the SEO solution. Actually I was looking around as like as you, but at last I decided to be a self learner. From this, my journey was started. Now I am a successfull Search Engine Optimization expert.</p>
<p>Actually we want to be high ranked in Google, Yahoo!, Bing or somewhere. And we search the tutorial, free training for seo around the world. But please belive me most of the major search engines has their own techniques, own guidelines, own materials that can really make sense to you to make your site Search Engine friendly. I am not here to sell any books, any materials, any tutorial to you for money!! I have money ( Lolzzz, Really I have?, Ok forget it!!). I am here to open your eyes for a good &amp; better SEO practice. I will not suggest you to take my techniques, follow my guidelines. I am just saying that "Please open your eye &amp; try to be self learner". By this quotation mark speech you can save lot of money I think (If you really work for your own necessity).</p>
<p>In 13 November, 2008 Google published a "Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide" for SEO campaign starter. I have read this guide. It is really a best guide I ever seen. Why we will go for buy or take any training. We want our sites in Google Search Engine, So nobody can tell me about SEO than Google. Isn't it? Do you believe Google? If you do, you can download this guide from the following download here button.</p>

Since few years I am using various kinds of Concept modelling tools like Mind Map, UML, etc.. But always I found a common question that is why programmers should use Mind Map. My answer is so much straight forward and that is &#8220;I prefer Mind Map than any other modelling tools because Mind Map is too much informal than others. It&#8217;s perfect for randomized ideas.&#8221;

As a web programmer basically I need to design concept visually and also I need to solve complex and large problem sets.

Simply I have some keypoints-
*	Mind Map is too much formal than others.
*	Anybody can use this techniques but to use UML and other techniques you need to study on that.
*	You just organize Ideas without any rules, your ideas your rules
*	Mind Map doesn&#8217;t follow any special convention
*	It&#8217;s useful to design your random concepts
*	It can be used to build a concepts from too many pieces of ideas
*	No specific drawing rules
*	No specific symbol. Just use as you like to understand it
*	So much helpful to solve programming solution
*	New feature design of a software by gathering random concept
*	Solve large problems
*	Generate keywords for Problems, Solution, Learning, Implementing for a software or program
*	Very fast
*	Most of Mind Map tools are freeware and even open source project

I use [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net) in my UBUNTU notebook to generate and design concept and to find out solution of complex programming logic. I would suggest you to practice MindMap for your better research and conceptual creative works.

<p>Every people always eager to know what their environment (people, society) want from them? Yeah, it's natural. The differences between them and me that I have published my feel into my personal blog, nothing else.</p>
<p>What do you want from me? I am very much little boy and everything is stored as a little piece inside me. I don't know who want what? So I need to know. Because my output should follow them. What the other people want from me? I can't give anything to anybody. hahahaha. No, it's not true. I am not in smiling mood.</p>
<p>I always ?want to help the people who are helpless, aimless, stayed away from their own path. But where am I? If anybody misunderstood me, that is really a thing to be shocked. I walked with any kinds of environment, people, situation. And also I learned ?a lot and still learning. But what do you want from me? I didn't get the answer yet!! Sometimes I feel very frustrated about this matter. Really you should want something from me if you are having me as a person and if you live in the society. But I don't know how can I understand what other people want from me? Someone want through their voice, and it is real? Or somebody don't tell. If the speech through the mouth is true then really I am not like that.</p>
<p>Please don't disallow me. I am also a social person like you and other though you may now me as a vagabond. But I have something for you, for the society.</p>

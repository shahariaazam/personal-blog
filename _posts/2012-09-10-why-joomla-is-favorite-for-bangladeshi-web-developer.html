<p>I have searched a lot about this topics and also discussed with few of smart and skilled Joomla developer in Bangladesh. I am sharing the summery of this issue.</p>
<p>Most of the Bangladeshi webmasters are familiar with Joomla than wordpress or other CMS. They are mostly familiar with only Joomla. And most of the old aged web developers of Bangladesh are developing website in Joomla. Joomla is an old and large CMS. There are few web development training institute in Bangladesh and most of their teachers are old aged and familiar or expert in Joomla that's why they are motivating their users to use Joomla. Even I have heard that 'I know Joomla' when someone meet with Job interview board. hahahaha. Just funny. Even somebody know Joomla but they haven't any knowledge on PHP. It's funny to me. Isn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="info_box">Bangladeshi web developers are learning Joomla by being motivated by their senior web developers of GURU. But they never know the comparison about Joomla with Wordpress or others. They are just following their senior guru.</div>
<p>90% of Bangladeshi web developer know Joomla because of their?<span class="hihglight2">senior guru</span>?but they don't know others. It's one kind of de-motivation. It's something like the following quote-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

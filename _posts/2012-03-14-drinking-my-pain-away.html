<p>Feeling so sick. I am suffering from fever since 9 days and doctor told me that I am under weight. The whole physical condition of my body is not well.</p>
<p>Though I am alone. and still working for my company and I am proud of it. Because I know without me there is nobody to complete those tasks. I hope everything is going well. I can't talk through mobile, I can't go to office with this condition of body. Totally I am helpless. Today none of my room mate is in my room they have gone away to their home. I am still struggling to drinking my pain way..... Still praying to god to make me well soon!!</p>

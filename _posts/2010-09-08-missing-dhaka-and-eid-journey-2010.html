<p>It is now 10:07 AM, 08 th september 2010. I am on the bus and leaving dhaka for the holy eid day celebration. But i am missing the dhaka city very much.</p>
<p>I am going to my family what is an another world for me. And this dhaka city has given me the environment, lifestyle, thoughts, the ability to feel the reality that is so much hard, has tought me to love someone, knowing someone thats make me to love this dhaka city. What is unavailable here! </p>
<p>After passing an Unbelievable hard life, i am loving this city because it gives me lot that i never got from any other place. But now i am going to join with my family from where ican't get any inspiration even nothing that has already given by this city. i like to love others, others also love me, repect me it's my everything. I have create my own world in this dhaka city.</p>
<p>So i am missing it very much.  even i am missing this such a way how i can't love my family, others.</p>
<p>i am praying to GOD that he will bring me back to my world. Happy EID.</p>

Hey everybody.. I am regularly trying to post some new, basic & more useful posts for you to develop yourself. It is a fun of me. Today I will introduce you

## &#8216;How you can upload your files from your PC to your website or web server&#8217;

**FileZilla** is the best choice of me & probably you. Because you will have to upload & download files or content from your website or webserver (interaction between web server & your local PC) through any FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client software. **FileZilla** is my best choice because I like open Source & this software is totally open source & it regularly give you updated module that is better for your healthy interaction with web & your local computer.

So, Today I have decided to share my knowledge with FileZilla FTP software about how it works&#8230;

Follow the following steps to reach your webserver directory for working with it&#8217;s content:

####First Step:

Downlaod the `FileZilla` software (for download, [click here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php)) and install it into your computer.

####Second Step:

Open FileZilla.

In the Hostname input box put your website address (i.e.- shahariaaza.com) & in Username put your `FTP username` & in Password field put your `password here` & then press `Quickconnect`.

Now your FileZilla will connect your web FTP server & it will show a status screen as like as following:

Now you will show a dialogue box.

as like as the same above image, you will see two column left column is your local PC directory locator & right side column is your Remote PC directory locator.

####Third Step:

Now you can select any file from your local PC & right click on the file & upload it to your destination directory. Same you can download file from your web server directory.

N.B: Always upload your website content into your web server&#8217;s &#8216;www&#8217; or &#8216;public_html&#8217; folder.

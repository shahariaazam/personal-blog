Geographical position based features are now being a popular trends for Web Application developer Â cause you can make the taste of your apps differently for different local people and it&#8217;s really interesting. In Bangladesh there is no web apps which is implementing this high tech features. But we should.

In Bangladesh most of the web sites are built using one of the popular open sources CMS and most of their investor&#8217;s idea are business oriented. That&#8217;s why new and high tech features are not being implementing in their projects that&#8217;s why Bangladeshi people are getting service but they are not getting the real taste of web technology. We have so many large large web development company in Bangladesh but they even can&#8217;t get such professional programmer who are familiar with these kinds of high tech features. I am going to tell you such high tech features and I can suggest you to implement at least one of them in your web application.

*	GEO-Position
*	Advertisement Network based on impression
*	Local Search Engine
*	Use of CDN service
*	Ajax and high-end User Interface
*	Mobile application

and so many more&#8230;. We should implement those high tech features otherwise we never go up in this age.

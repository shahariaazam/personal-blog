<p>I am a real music lover. And I love to hear the song with understanding the lyrics. Here I am mentioning some parts of lyrics which has a real meaning and I like it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Drain the pressure from the swelling,<br />
This sensations overwhelming,<br />
Give me a long kiss goodnight<br />
and everything will be alright<br />
Tell me that I won't feel a thing<br />
So give me Novacaine <strong>--<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> [Give me Novacaine by Green Day]</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day<br />
Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time<br />
Is there a hero somewhere, someone who will never walk away<br />
Who doesn't turn a blind eye to a crime -- <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Locking up the sun by Poets of The Fall]</span></strong></p></blockquote>

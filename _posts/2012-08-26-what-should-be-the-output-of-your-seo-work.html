<p>Many people are eager to know actually what should be the OUTPUT of their SEO work? How they will represent their result in Google SERP (Search Engine Result Page). That's why I am here to see you few of my personal SEO work's output.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1579" title="Bangladeshi Freelancer" src="http://www.shahariaazam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bangladeshi-freelancer-Google-Search.png" alt="Freelancer of Bangladesh" width="574" height="307" /></p>
<p>For the keyword <span class="hihglight2">Bangladeshi Freelancer</span>?you should see my name and my website address in Google Search Engine Result Page (SERP)</p>
<div class="tip_box">ONLY HIGH PAGERANK DOESN'T DEFINE YOUR SEO PROGRESS. SERP REPRESENTATION IS MORE IMPORTANT TO BRING YOUR AUDIENCE TO YOUR WEBSITE</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">?<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1583" title="Shaharia Azam on Google Search Engine Result" src="http://www.shahariaazam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/shaharia-azam-Google-Search.png" alt="Shaharia Azam - Popular Web Developer in Bangladesh" width="499" height="383" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Simply this types of representation will make your impression good to your visitor. In the above Google SERP you are seeing my own developed Wordpress Plugin repository link. And beneath the url you are seeing rating. Of course this rating will send your visitor to your source url cause they will definitely understand that people are talking positive about this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<div class="info_box">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not only to bring your website address on top of search result. The most basic and primary goal for SEO to increase your traffic for your site. So FIRST IMPRESSION CAN NEVER BE BACK. So you should represent your content in Search Engine Result page more interactively and if you can follow Google's own technique then obviously your SEO work will progress to a SMARTER level. Always try to understand the CORE and don't be PANIC</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will tell more about <span class="hihglight2">How to do SEO smartly</span>?but I need your response so that I can understand your needs. Post your comments here and I will try to reply all of you.? ? ??<br class="clear" /></p>

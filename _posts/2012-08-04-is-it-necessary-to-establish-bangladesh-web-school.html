<p>I am not talking about the as usual educational institutions in Bangladesh. I am talking about to establish Bangladesh Web School. It's so much necessary. In Bangladesh there are no such great institutions for teaching modern web technology. They are also teaching as usual old tutorial. But a?numerous number of young people are really interested to contribute in this Web technology sector. But there is no proper guidelines. That's why may be it can be better to establish a Bangladesh Web School. So that this BD Web School can be a great source for getting proper knowledge on web development.</p>
<p>Now a days in Bangladesh there are so many young people are related with outsourcing and they are doing as freelancer. But most of the work is related with Web. So education in web technology is undoubtedly ?necessary. I wish I can see a school like Bangladesh Web school where people can go to learn Web Technology.</p>

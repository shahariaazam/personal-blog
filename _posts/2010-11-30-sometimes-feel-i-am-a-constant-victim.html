<p>When I try to regain myself and try to back to my way then some environment help me to feel like 'I am a constant victim'. But it's not true.</p>
<p>I lead a very simple life and my thoughts, emotions are as like as a real baby. Pure feelings, honesty making me a good boy. But sometimes some people make me crazy, make me tensed. Automatically some sad come to my mind. But always I am afraid of sadness, tension. But it comes naturally and regularly to my life. And then I start to think me as a 'Constant Victim'. This victimization is making some obstacle to redraw my own way to think about myself positively.</p>
<p>Whatever, no problem. I am continuing to lead my life whether it is good or bad. But still alive with a tons of hope, humanity, honesty and love.</p>

<p>On 1 June Tuesday I have taken a sudden decision about to go to Satkhira. But anybody know why I have taken this decision. May be 'Not'. Because in the mean time my mother has also come to Satkhira from our home village. I have said to all that I am going to meet my mother.</p>
<p>Whatever, this journey was for someone rather than my mother. Because I see mother &amp; can see my mother regularly but I can't see that person regularly even not after years not after months.</p>
<p>This satkhira journey was something strange to me also. Because she has called me before I come to Satkhira. I think that she really want to see me. But no. She actually wants me to say something that was really hurt me. When I come infront her, then she called her intimate person..tell story &amp; show me how she loves him. What's this?</p>
<p>I can't understand why everything call me &amp; show me the real shit. Actually from this journey I am taking &amp; seeing some previous sorrow. What will be my mental situation after coming back to dhaka- only god knows. After all, I always like her.. love her but I know... It is now impossible to make it real.</p>
<p>Today I will go back to Dhaka &amp; will also bring some extra &amp; new version of sorrow.</p>
<p>Hey GOD.... Is it you..?.... who are doing all the things. Then, why all this things coming towards me. You don't want me happy I know always know.... Hey GOD... How more time how much time you will stop all this things. I am really destroying.</p>

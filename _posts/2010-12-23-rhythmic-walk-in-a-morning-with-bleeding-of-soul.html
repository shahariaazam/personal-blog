<p>Today I was trying to go for sleep as soon as I can. But I can't. Since some days I am awake whole the night. I don't know I can't bring sleep. In this morning I was going to walk alone in the morning street at Dhaka. It's really nice.</p>

<p>I was singing and repeatedly I was playing some soft English music in my smart-phone. It's my practice of build up my philosophy. I can take many many decision through this kinds of activities madly. I was thinking.. thinking a lot. Sometimes slow... sometimes fast walk and unstoppable smoking. Great cool weather. Missing something in my life. Thinking about people, thinking about me. My soul was just bleeding with my thinking. So much frustrated activities.. huh!! Yes. But sometimes it is necessary. Because when you have nobody then you have to walk alone through the path. This can be defined as a practice. hahahaha... lolzz.</p>
<p>One song I was remembering in the morning when I was walking that is 'Pages' by '3 Doors Down'. I have mentioned that below to my write-up:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Pages"</strong> by 3 Doors Down</p>
<p>What happens to a man when<br />
He spills his heart on a page and<br />
He watches words flow away then<br />
His feelings lie on the page alone<br />
There waiting<br />
For someone who cares to read them<br />
To open their eyes to see them<br />
To see if they can make his thoughts their own<br />
To find out that maybe your life's not perfect<br />
Maybe it's not worth what he gives away</p>
<p>You can see that this broken soul is bleeding<br />
So you concede your feelings inside yourself<br />
And wander through my heart<br />
Letting you see through me<br />
Now only consumes me<br />
Forget your pain, watch me fall apart</p>
<p>What happens to a soul when<br />
It's trapped inside his emotions<br />
And all of these words he's spoken<br />
They bind him to the life he's left behind<br />
And every new step he takes<br />
He knows that he might not make it<br />
To all of these dreams that he has yet to find</p>
<p>Maybe your life's not perfect<br />
But maybe it's not worth what he gives away<br />
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding<br />
So you concede your feelings inside yourself<br />
And wander through my heart<br />
Letting you see through me<br />
Now only consumes me<br />
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart</p>
<p>You can see that this broken soul is bleeding<br />
So you concede your feelings inside yourself<br />
And wander through my heart<br />
Letting you see through me<br />
Now only consumes me<br />
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart<br />
As i fall apart</p>

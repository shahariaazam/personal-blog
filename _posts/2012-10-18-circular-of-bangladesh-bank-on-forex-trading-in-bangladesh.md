On 12 January 2012 [Bangladesh Bank](http://www.bangladesh-bank.org) has published a public circular on **Forex Trading from Bangladesh**. It says any kinds of illegal activities related to Forex trading has been banned. And any kinds of fraudent activities will not be permitted by government authorities.

So Forex is not banned from Bangladesh.  Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947 these kinds of activities will be considered as crime. Because only authorized foreign exchanger can exchange money. So for becoming more conscious Bangladesh bank has published this circular recently.

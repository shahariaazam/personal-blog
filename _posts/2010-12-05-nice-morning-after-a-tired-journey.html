<p>Previous night at 4 AM I have reached my lovely city. I know it's not lovely for so many people. But in this city I try to make my dream true.</p>
<p>Again I am come back to my city. I was going my village home for an instant visit because of my parents. They have just come back from Hajj. I always miss my mother. To see her I went my home.</p>
<p>I will not tell about the feelings at my home. That is another chapter for my life. Because I am really a vagabond. I have no family, I have no best friends. It's sometimes making my life questioned. But still continuing.</p>
<p>Again in my Dhaka City and will start my own walking toward my dreams as I expect that's my love.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">To promote your business or products or services 'Social Media Marketing' method is the most smartest way in this age of technology. There are so many sophisticated audience in front of this social media and the number is very large.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[adsense_id="3"]</p>
<p>Dell, Intel, FedEx, ComCast, CISCO even a huge number of the popular companies are building their social media marketing strategy and they are getting a good result. But in our Bangladesh it's right that rich-media (Internet, Computer) is not available to use for all. After that there is a large and active community are involving with Social Media.<a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/asia.htm"> 995,560 of total number of people</a> are involved with Internet and approx. 83% of them are using social media. So it's not a small deal. Actually in this way one sentence can change your though. That is "People will bring and send you others, Easy to going most of the audience". Can we see the below image?</p>

<p>Some story has in this social media industry. By the end of 2009,</p>
<ul>
<li> Dell had generated $6.5 million in sales from Twitter alone.</li>
<li>Comcast has helped over 150,000 customers through Social Media.</li>
<li>Starbucks gave their consumers a voice, Resulting in over 50,000 product ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bangladesh this social media strategy is not being practiced. But we should. We think we should think globally. Most of our country's largest largest company are not using social media. But yes of course social media is a very strong tools to reach to the audience within short time and short investment.</p>

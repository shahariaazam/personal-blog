<p>There are some little  matter. Going to be covered under shadow. But don't know why it is  coming more slightly. Don't want to be change. Don't see even never see  this. It's just a flow of blood in heaven. Hundreds of dream even  million of dreams are going to be freaky. And I think I am the last one  who are seeing this flow of blood.</p>
<p>This was just written  in my eyes and don't want to make change. Just think some small drop of  flow of blood but it is in the heaven. After passing a lonely and a  strange night I meet some air of earth who is breathing itself from the  flow of blood. Just tried to keep me behind the blood. But at last I  can't imagine what is going on. But I can't. Really can't touch the  heart of heaven where are full of some flows of bloods.</p>
<p>The  scene behind the sea is just like a storm which has no sounds of air,  no covering with sky.. just a little bit freaky. Uffffff this is the  real truth of the world where has no heaven where has no human even not  the creator because I don't think so that it's not the world of mine and  I am going to be a ghost like the star. Because some star works for  whole the day but nobody can see it. But it does it's duty.</p>
<p>I  am almost in the finishing line where just 1 inch left behind from the  no-man's lands of my new world of something. So I have to enter the  world where there is no stranger to take me out...</p>
<p>Bye for today. I will come back again and I will try to speak again. Because I am alive. Don't try to like this.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

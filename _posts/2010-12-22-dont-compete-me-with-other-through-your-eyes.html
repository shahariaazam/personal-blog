<p>Don't.. don't. Don't compete me with other through your eyes. Just judge somebody with their way to become success. The way.. not the whole thing.</p>
<p>There is no competition in this world.? Compete with someone's way to complete their goal. Please find the way of others which way they are walking.</p>

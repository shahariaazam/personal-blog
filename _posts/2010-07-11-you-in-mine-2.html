<p>Today I am feeling you very much. I know you aren't hearing my voice of heart. I love you just as like mother loves her child. I really miss you. Please come back. Please say "I love you". Where are you? Why sometimes you came to me over the phone. Over the people, over everything I really can't imagine that. Please again touch me. Please again write some love letter, please again write some voice in my diary.</p>
<p>You are always in my life. But I know you are now for other person. I want to take care of you. I cry for you when raining. I cry for you when I see dream in night. Please please please come back to me. I want to hear your voice. Nobody in the world love me.. Nothing is OK without you. Why you say me to say I love you. But at the end you abandon me. I don't know that you're missing me. I really miss you. How I will say I love you? Can you read my mind. I want to en-light my life through your eyes. You are always beside me but not as a real human you are always with me as a hidden angel. How are you today? I know you are very much OK with your new heart.</p>
<p>You have no place in your heart to love me. But my heart is bleeding with a ton of blood. I cry for you, I want to smile again. I want to discover what love is? I am mad of you. Why you came to my life. then whey you just go back without me. What's my fault? I can't take love from anybody. I can't give love to anybody. You are the one by whom I am here. Now you are only in my dream. Where are you? Now I am crying, crying a lot. My tears are telling your name. Please stop my drop of tears. Please please. After sometimes after why you came back to my mind? I can't stay.</p>
<p>I can't live without you. I can't, I will not. Please tell me that you will love me as like as you have done before. You taught me how to love, how to smile. But I can't. Please please please came back to my mind.</p>
